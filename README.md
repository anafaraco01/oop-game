# Protect your identity
TEAM 14 | Bartosz, Ana, Preciousgift and Excel

## Game and team introduction
Our intention for this project was to create an educational game for children between 10 and 12 years old from the Netherlands. The purpose of this game is to teach the children how to protect their identity by confronting them with everyday identity-theft scenarios but in a fun and entertaining way that will retain the children's Attention span. 
The project group consists of four members: Bartosz, Ana, Preciousgift and Excel - first-year students of Information and Communication Technology (HBO-ICT). 
This game, as required, is written in TypeScript language. 
The language of the game is English. Nonetheless, questions may be translated in Dutch before the start of the game.

## The Game
The idea of this game derives from "Subway surfers". In this game, you must run and to avoid all dangers appearing on your way simultaneously - identity thieves, messages, mails, and holes. If you crash against any obstacle (except one) a question pops up. If you answer correctly you continue without negative consequences but if you answer wrongly, you lose one life. In your entire game, you have three lives. When you either lose all your lives or fall into a hole, your game is over. In order to make the game more curious, you will run through some biomes and countries and also you can encounter little surprises like additional life powerup and temporary slowdown snail.

## Game control
The game makes use of the D-Pad of the keyboard to control the player. Use the UP arrow key to jump, use the DOWN arrow key to slide, and then use the LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys to move left and right on the screen. To answer a question, you need to use your mouse.
